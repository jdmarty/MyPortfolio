                <h2 class="text-center">Hi! Welcome to my page</h2>
                <p>My name is Josh, and I am a student in the UC Irvine Fullstack Flex Web Development Bootcamp. I'm a lifelong learner currently on a path to build a new career in web development</p>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to start my journey when I started my first job out of college. After finishing my Bachelors in Chemical Engineering, I found myself working as a project engineer for a glass manufacturing company
                    While I found the experience valuable, I was shocked at how primitive their quality systems were. Specifically, the fact that engineers had to spend on average 2-4 hours a day painstakingly copying data points from
                    PDFs to Excel Spreadsheets by hand. I new there had to be a better way, so I applied my, at the time, <strong>VERY</strong> limited knowledge of Visual Basic to write a macro that would automatically import data
                    from one file to another. It was clunky and ugly, but it was also a hit with the other engineers. And more importantly, I had a blast!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since, I have had a drive to find ways to help people work faster and smarter through intuitive workflow and simple, user-focused design. That is why I am committed to learning as much as I can about how
                    the tools we use everyday are designed, and how they can be improved. This first step into an antiquated coding language opened my eyes to the astounding world of web development and software engineering.
                    From simple HTML webpages to React Apps and Fullstack Projects, I am beyond excited to see where this path will take me, and ecstatic to learn everything, from everyone, all the time!
